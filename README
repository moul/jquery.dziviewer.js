This is a proof of concept.
I tried to extend [openzoom.js](https://github.com/openzoom/openzoom.js) and learned [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script).

For working DeepZoom viewer without flash, try out :
- [jquery-seadragon.js](https://github.com/MrSwitch/jquery-seadragon.js)
- [SeadragonHotspots](https://github.com/thingsinjars/SeadragonHotspots)
- [openseadragon](https://github.com/thatcher/openseadragon)
- [seajax-utils](https://github.com/rsimon/seajax-utils)

Inspired by :
- [deepzoom.py](https://github.com/openzoom/deepzoom.py)
- [openzoom.js](https://github.com/openzoom/openzoom.js)
- [tileviewer](http://code.google.com/p/tileviewer)
